# yelp-camp-web-project

This is my first web project deployment.

The project contains my current learnings on web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, Mongo database, Git version control, DOM manipulation, EJS engine, Authentication, GeoCoding, Security Policies, Browser cookies, Session, and all the fine details for a production-ready web app.

This web app was deployed using:

- Heroku app container for Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- Github for open version control
- Cloudinary API for stock images
- Mapbox for geocoding and map-view
- Express js for web back-end
- EJS for web front-end UI
- various Node.js apps for Authentication, Security, Session and Cookies control

I will be using React.js for the project front-end UI soon!
